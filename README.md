# Note to Repository Viewer
Hi! This is my first repository on GitHub, I am using it to create my website project.

# Dobu Martial Arts Website Project
This is a project that is being done in University. I am using GitHub's pull and merge systems to help with development.

This repository only website files. Any documentation or concept and/or test plans are documents that remain private.

# How will creating this document on GitHub do any good?
I can use the GitHub merge and action logs as part of my evaluation.

# Why this instead of the old domain?
The old system required me to use SSH and other remote tools that could be blocked by Firewall. GitHub is well known so it's not likely it'll be blocked.

# What about the old DevBox and files on it?
Don't fret, I cloned the website directory, everything still remains.
