# Dubo Martial Arts Website Project
This is a project that is being done in University. I am using GitHub's pull and merge systems to help with development.

# Why this instead of the old domain?
The old system required me to use SSH and other remote tools that could be blocked by Firewall. GitHub is well known so it's not likely it'll be blocked.

# What about the old DevBox and files on it?
Don't fret, I cloned the website directory, everything still remains.
